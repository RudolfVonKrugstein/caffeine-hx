PATCH REQUESTS
==============
Any time a std library file (one that is part of Haxe distribution) is edited, the changes must
be surrounded by a PR tag. The tool prtool.n can be run to write a full patch request for
submitting. The patch output is writtend to stdout, and information messages to stderr.
It is built with tools.hxml in the root directory.


A patch request comment follows this format:

//BEGINPR/rw01/2008-02-07//My Name/A good commment describing the need for the change
...code...
//ENDPR/rw01///

rw01: A distinct (per file) code.
2008-02-07: the date the patch was created
//: null field filled in when the patch is submitted

The ENDPR tag should have the same code.

Please note that PR tags may not be embedded within another.
