The WordCount example is base3d on the Ruby code at
http://jchris.mfdz.com/posts/106

In order to run it, the three texts will need to be fetched from http://github.com/jchris/couchrest/tree/master/examples/word_count or get your own favourite large texts at Project Gutenburg http://www.gutenberg.org/, and change the WordCount.hx file to load your texts.

The first step is to run wordcount.n, which will populate the database. Each of the views will take some time to generate. Run them by opening your browser to:

http://localhost:5984/word-count-example/_view/word_count/count
http://localhost:5984/word-count-example/_view/word_count/words

After that completes, the following url should load instantly
http://localhost:5984/word-count-example/_view/word_count/words?startkey=[%22flight%22]&endkey=[%22flight%22,%22Z%22]

The demo for the newly indexed database is the file wordquery.n . Run it to see results from the Views that were generated in step 1.
