To run this example, first unzip the textfiles.zip file, run haxe build.hxml and startup MemeDB.

To create the database structure and the views, run
neko create.n [host] [port]

To add a textfile to the database run
neko addbook.n [host] [port] [textfile]
The textfiles are split up into 'Pages' of 100 lines of text, and the resulting record in
the database is named "filename-Page[xx]" where filename has had it's extension removed.

To run the demo
neko query.n [host] [port]
