Changes
=======
MemeDbHandler:
	All errors now in JSON format for easier interface with client connection libraries. Avoid the use of (HttpServletRespose)response.sendError(), as this bypasses the JSON responses.

Authentication:
	A few abstract methods added, just as future placeholders for document level permissions. isAuthorizedUpdateDocument(String db, String id) etc

FileSystemBackend:
	Multiple directories now created based on the backend.fs.depth property. Anything other than ReiserFS will choke on too many entries in the monolithic directory structure
	Document id's now properly encoded to avoid the id ../otherdb/storeMeHere exploit

Content-type:
	All JSON documents are now application/json. When sent to the client (/httpd/*), they are reported as text/plain;charset=utf-8. This avoids browsers trying to download the application/json. The application/javascript, text/javascript are reserved for use in document/TextDocument.java, since this makes it possible to serve raw javascript just like binary documents are. JSON is not javascript, such as it can not be executed by the browser.

VIEWS
=====
AdHoc Views:
	{
		"language": "javascript",  // no text/javascript anymore. Doesn't keep with other languages... there's no text/D or text/C++
		"map": "function(doc) {}",
		"reduce": "function(keyValue[]) {}"
	}

Regular Views
	{
		"language": "javascript",
		"views": {
			"name": {
				"map": "function(doc)..."
			}
			"ireducestuff": {
				"map": "function(doc)...",
				"reduce": "function(keyValue[])"
			}
		}
	}

Thoughts:
	Design documents like Couch, however they should not be in the general document population and thus subject to map/reduce.

DOCUMENTS
=========
	A rev needs to be supplied to update a document, either in the _rev field of a JSON document, or as a ?rev= query param. Currently (due to the nature of the handler), if neither is supplied, the document will overwrite regardless.  Whether this is left in as a feature is a question.
	There still needs to be some conflict resolution done for updating a revision that is out of date.

OTHER
=====


MOVED/RENAMED
/auth/DocumentCredentials -> /auth/UserCredentials
	Reason: Original name suggested credentials that apply to documents. The auth will be reworked based on user/group/other + record credentials


TODO
====
	Standardize error response codes. Message field should be a set of known error codes, like CONFLICT or AUTH_ERROR whatever. The reason field can provide a text description. The status field?
